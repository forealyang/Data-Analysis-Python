# Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis-Python
Project brief: 
Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. Instacart stakeholders are most interested in the variety of customers in their database along with their purchasing behaviors. They are considering a targeted marketing strategy and want to target different customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see whether they have an effect on the sale of their products.

Project objectives: 

Clean and merge four data sets: orders, products, department, and customer data.

Analyze the data to answer questions from marketing and sales teams (for example, busiest time of day,highest grossing days of the week, most loyal customers, etc.).

Analyze the data to discover differences in user's ordering habits based various characteristics (such as region, income, loyalty status, etc.).

Create customer profiles based on combinations of variables and analyze how their ordering behaviors may differ (for instance: pet owners, vegetarian/vegan, etc.).

Key Questions:
-The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day are in order to schedule ads when there are fewer orders. 
-They want to know if there are particular times of day when people spend the most money 
-Which departments have the highest frequency of product orders?
-What is the distribution of users according to brand loyalty?
-Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer's loyalty status?
-Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer's region?
-Is there a connection between age and family status(number of dependents) in terms of ordering habits?
-What different classifications does the demographic information suggest?
-What differences can you find in ordering habits of different customer profiles?

# Data

# Tools 
Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Scipy

Software: Jupyter Notebooks and Excel

# Skills Demonstrated 
Cleaning data: removed duplicates, found and resolved missing values, addressed mixed or incorrect data types.

Merging data: selected and prepared data for merging, confirmed merge was successful, and exported final merge as a pkl file.

Exploratory analysis: explored basic descriptive statistics (max/min, quartiles, mean, standard deviation) for each variable as well as using histograms, scatterplots, and bar and line charts to explore the distributions of data.

Derived new variables: grouped data by user, order, and department to allow exploration and analysis at each level; used aggregated data to create flags about user ordering habits (such as ‘new customer’, ‘loyal customer’, etc.) and demographic info (such as ‘with babies’ or ‘pet owner’); confirmed the new data created via crosstabs and value counts.

Visualizing data: used Matplotlib and Seaborn to create histograms, line charts, pie charts, and bar charts (vertical/horizontal, stacked, and 100% stacked).

Reporting results: provided an Excel file that explained the answers to questions from sales/marketing as well as documenting the data population flow, consistency checks, data wrangling, and column derivations.
