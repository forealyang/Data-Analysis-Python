# Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis-Python
Project brief: 
Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. Instacart stakeholders are most interested in the variety of customers in their database along with their purchasing behaviors. They are considering a targeted marketing strategy and want to target different customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see whether they have an effect on the sale of their products. My job as the analyst is to inform what this strategy might look like to ensure Instacart targets the right customer profiles with the appropriate products. 

Key Questions:
-The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day are in order to schedule ads when there are fewer orders. 
-They want to know if there are particular times of day when people spend the most money 
-Which departments have the highest frequency of product orders?
-What is the distribution of users according to brand loyalty?
-Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer's loyalty status?
-Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer's region?
-Is there a connection between age and family status(number of dependents) in terms of ordering habits?
-What different classifications does the demographic information suggest?
-What differences can you find in ordering habits of different customer profiles?
